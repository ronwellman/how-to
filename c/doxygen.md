# Doxygen
Auto generate some of the documentation for your project.

### Install
```bash
sudo apt install doxygen
```

### Generate Config
```bash
doxygen -g NEW_CONFIG_FILE
```

Now edit that config according to the options you want.  I typically turn off HTML as I only care about the LATEX file to build a PDF from. I also set my source and documentation folder.  Most of the defaults will be just fine.

```bash
vi NEW_CONFIG_FILE
```

### Document Your Functions
I typically do this inside of my .h file.
```c
/**
 * \file timestable.h
 * \author CW2 Joshua Wellman
 * \date 29 Jun 2018
 *
 * \brief Generates multiplication tables.
 *
 * Timestables generates multiplication tables to the CLI.  It accepts either
 * no arguments, in which case it will return a 10x10 table, a MAX number in
 * which case it will generate from table ranging from one to MAX, or you can
 * specify a custom MIN and MAX range.  Regardless of which inputs it is
 * given, it will only generate tables between 1 and 100 inclusive.

/**

 *
 * \brief counts the number of characters dropping leading zeros
 *
 * This function counts the number of elements in the character array dropping
 * any leading zeros.

 */
int strlen_nlz(const char* s);

```

### Run Doxygen
```bash
doxygen NEW_CONFIG_FILE
```
This will search your files for the doxygen comments and will output the resulting latex files.

### Build PDF
```bash
cd doc/latex/
make
```

### Combine With My Other PDFs and Output Final PDF
```bash
pdfunite doc/MY_PROGRAM.pdf doc/latex/refman.pdf doc/MY_PROGRAM_FINAL.pdf
```
