# Dell XPS 8700
Steps I routinely have to go through to get my XPS desktop back up and running
after a new install.

# Network
```bash
sudo apt install broadcom-sta-dkms
sudo shutdown -r now
```

# Audio
Shows up as dummy output

1. Modprobe
```
sudo echo "options snd-hda-intel model=auto" >> /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
```

1. Force Reload
```
alsamixer
pulseaudio -k | sudo alsa force-reload
```

1. Pacmd
This worked under Ubuntu Mate 18.04 but stopped working after I upgraded to
19.04 and 19.10.  Under PopOS! 19.10 the sound contol shows nothing but in
pavucontrol, it shows the updated control and sounds actually works. However,
it did not survive reboot.
```
sudo apt install pavucontrol
pacmd list-cards
pacmd set-card-profile alsa_card.pci-0000_00_1b.0 output:analog-stereo+input:analog-stereo
pavucontrol
```

1. Pulseaudio Default
I took the information from using pacmd and hardcoded the profile in pulseaudio
default config. This still looks broken when you look under sound settings in
PoPOS! but sound worked in Firefox.
```
sudo cp /etc/pulse/default.pa /etc/pulse/default.bak
sudo vi /etc/pulse/default.pa
set-card-profile alsa_card.pci-0000_00_1b.0 output:analog-stereo+input:analog-stereo
sudo shutdown -r now
```
